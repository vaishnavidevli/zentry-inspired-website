# Zentry-Inspired Award-Winning Website  

A visually captivating and interactive website inspired by [Zentry](https://zentry.com/).  
This project focuses on **scroll-triggered animations**, **geometric transitions**, and **immersive video storytelling** to deliver a luxurious, modern feel — the kind of experience you’d expect from an **Awwwards-winning website**.  

I built this project by following [Adrian Hajdin’s YouTube tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/@javascriptmastery), as a way to better understand **React.js** and **GSAP** for building smooth, animation-heavy user experiences.
